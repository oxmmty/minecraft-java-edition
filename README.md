## Installing Panda3D

The latest Panda3D SDK can be downloaded from
[this page](https://www.panda3d.org/download/sdk-1-10-13/).
If you are familiar with installing Python packages, you can use
the following command:

```bash
pip install panda3d
```

The easiest way to install the latest development build of Panda3D
into an existing Python installation is using the following command:

```bash
pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://archive.panda3d.org/ panda3d
```

If this command fails, please make sure your version of pip is up-to-date.

If you prefer to install the full SDK with all tools, the latest development
builds can be obtained from [this page](https://www.panda3d.org/download.php?version=devel&sdk).

These are automatically kept up-to-date with the latest GitHub version of Panda.
